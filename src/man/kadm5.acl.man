.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The Kerberos \fIkadmind(8)\fP daemon uses an Access Control List
(ACL) file to manage access rights to the Kerberos database.
For operations that affect principals, the ACL file also controls
which principals can operate on which other principals.
.sp
The default location of the Kerberos ACL file is
\fB@LOCALSTATEDIR@\fP\fB/krb5kdc\fP\fB/kadm5.acl\fP  unless this is overridden by the \fIacl_file\fP
variable in \fIkdc.conf(5)\fP.
.SH SYNTAX
.sp
Empty lines and lines starting with the sharp sign (\fB#\fP) are
ignored.  Lines containing ACL entries have the format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
principal  permissions  [target_principal  [restrictions] ]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP Note
Line order in the ACL file is important.  The first matching entry
will control access for an actor principal on a target principal.
.RE
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIprincipal\fP
(Partially or fully qualified Kerberos principal name.) Specifies
the principal whose permissions are to be set.
.sp
Each component of the name may be wildcarded using the \fB*\fP
character.
.TP
.B \fIpermissions\fP
Specifies what operations may or may not be performed by a
\fIprincipal\fP matching a particular entry.  This is a string of one or
more of the following list of characters or their upper\-case
counterparts.  If the character is \fIupper\-case\fP, then the operation
is disallowed.  If the character is \fIlower\-case\fP, then the operation
is permitted.

.B \fItarget_principal\fP
(Optional. Partially or fully qualified Kerberos principal name.)
Specifies the principal on which \fIpermissions\fP may be applied.
Each component of the name may be wildcarded using the \fB*\fP
character.
.sp
\fItarget_principal\fP can also include back\-references to \fIprincipal\fP,
in which \fB*number\fP matches the corresponding wildcard in
\fIprincipal\fP.
.TP
.B \fIrestrictions\fP
(Optional) A string of flags. Allowed restrictions are:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B {+|\-}\fIflagname\fP
flag is forced to the indicated value.  The permissible flags
are the same as the + and \- flags for the kadmin
\fIadd_principal\fP and \fImodify_principal\fP commands.
.TP
.B \fI\-clearpolicy\fP
policy is forced to be empty.
.TP
.B \fI\-policy pol\fP
policy is forced to be \fIpol\fP.
.TP
.B \-{\fIexpire, pwexpire, maxlife, maxrenewlife\fP} \fItime\fP
(\fIgetdate\fP string) associated value will be forced to
MIN(\fItime\fP, requested value).
.UNINDENT

.sp
The above flags act as restrictions on any add or modify operation
which is allowed due to that ACL line.

.IP Warning
If the kadmind ACL file is modified, the kadmind daemon needs to be
restarted for changes to take effect.

(line 1) Any principal in the \fBATHENA.MIT.EDU\fP realm with
an \fBadmin\fP instance has all administrative privileges.
.sp
(lines 1\-3) The user \fBjoeadmin\fP has all permissions with his
\fBadmin\fP instance, \fBjoeadmin/admin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU\fP (matches line
1).  He has no permissions at all with his null instance,
\fBjoeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU\fP (matches line 2).  His \fBroot\fP and other
non\-\fBadmin\fP, non\-null instances (e.g., \fBextra\fP or \fBdbadmin\fP) have
inquire and list permissions with any principal that has the
instance \fBroot\fP (matches line 3).
.sp
(line 4) Any \fBroot\fP principal in \fBATHENA.MIT.EDU\fP can inquire, list,
or change the password of their null instance, but not any other
null instance.  (Here, \fB*1\fP denotes a back\-reference to the
component matching the first wildcard in the actor principal.)
.sp
(line 5) Any principal in the realm \fBATHENA.MIT.EDU\fP (except for
\fBjoeadmin@ATHENA.MIT.EDU\fP, as mentioned above) has inquire
privileges.
.sp
(line 6) Finally, any principal with an \fBadmin\fP instance in \fBEXAMPLE.COM\fP
has all permissions, but any principal that they create or modify will
not be able to get postdateable tickets or tickets with a life of
longer than 9 hours.
