.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
kadmind starts the Kerberos administration server.  kadmind typically
runs on the master Kerberos server, which stores the KDC database.  If
the KDC database uses the LDAP module, the administration server and
the KDC server need not run on the same machine.  kadmind accepts
remote requests from programs such as \fIkadmin(1)\fP and
\fIkpasswd(1)\fP to administer the information in these database.
.sp
kadmind requires a number of configuration files to be set up in order
for it to work:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIkdc.conf(5)\fP
The KDC configuration file contains configuration information for
the KDC and admin servers.  kadmind uses settings in this file to
locate the Kerberos database, and is also affected by the
\fBacl_file\fP, \fBdict_file\fP, \fBkadmind_port\fP, and iprop\-related
settings.
.TP
.B \fIkadm5.acl(5)\fP
kadmind\(aqs ACL (access control list) tells it which principals are
allowed to perform administration actions.  The pathname to the
ACL file can be specified with the \fBacl_file\fP \fIkdc.conf(5)\fP
variable; by default, it is \fB@LOCALSTATEDIR@\fP\fB/krb5kdc\fP\fB/kadm5.acl\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
After the server begins running, it puts itself in the background and
disassociates itself from its controlling terminal.
.sp
kadmind can be configured for incremental database propagation.
Incremental propagation allows slave KDC servers to receive principal
and policy updates incrementally instead of receiving full dumps of
the database.  This facility can be enabled in the \fIkdc.conf(5)\fP
file with the \fBiprop_enable\fP option.  Incremental propagation
requires the principal \fBkiprop/MASTER\e@REALM\fP (where MASTER is the
master KDC\(aqs canonical host name, and REALM the realm name) to be
registered in the database.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-r\fP \fIrealm\fP
specifies the realm that kadmind will serve; if it is not
specified, the default realm of the host is used.
.TP
.B \fB\-m\fP
causes the master database password to be fetched from the
keyboard (before the server puts itself in the background, if not
invoked with the \fB\-nofork\fP option) rather than from a file on
disk.
.TP
.B \fB\-nofork\fP
causes the server to remain in the foreground and remain
associated to the terminal.  In normal operation, you should allow
the server to place itself in the background.
.TP
.B \fB\-port\fP \fIport\-number\fP
specifies the port on which the administration server listens for
connections.  The default port is determined by the
\fBkadmind_port\fP configuration variable in \fIkdc.conf(5)\fP.
.TP
.B \fB\-P\fP \fIpid_file\fP
specifies the file to which the PID of kadmind process should be
written after it starts up.  This file can be used to identify
whether kadmind is still running and to allow init scripts to stop
the correct process.
.TP
.B \fB\-p\fP \fIkdb5_util_path\fP
specifies the path to the kdb5_util command to use when dumping the
KDB in response to full resync requests when iprop is enabled.
.TP
.B \fB\-K\fP \fIkprop_path\fP
specifies the path to the kprop command to use to send full dumps
to slaves in response to full resync requests.
.TP
.B \fB\-F\fP \fIdump_file\fP
specifies the file path to be used for dumping the KDB in response
to full resync requests when iprop is enabled.
.TP
.B \fB\-x\fP \fIdb_args\fP
specifies database\-specific arguments.
.sp
Options supported for LDAP database are:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-x nconns=\fP\fInumber_of_connections\fP
specifies the number of connections to be maintained per
LDAP server.
.TP
.B \fB\-x host=\fP\fIldapuri\fP
specifies the LDAP server to connect to by URI.
.TP
.B \fB\-x binddn=\fP\fIbinddn\fP
specifies the DN of the object used by the administration
server to bind to the LDAP server.  This object should
have read and write privileges on the realm container, the
principal container, and the subtree that is referenced by
the realm.
.TP
.B \fB\-x bindpwd=\fP\fIbind_password\fP
specifies the password for the above mentioned binddn.
Using this option may expose the password to other users
on the system via the process list; to avoid this, instead
stash the password using the \fBstashsrvpw\fP command of
\fIkdb5_ldap_util(8)\fP.
.TP
.B \fB\-x debug=\fP\fIlevel\fP
sets the OpenLDAP client library debug level.  \fIlevel\fP is
an integer to be interpreted by the library.  Debugging
messages are printed to standard error, so this option
must be used with the \fB\-nofork\fP option to be useful.
New in release 1.12.
